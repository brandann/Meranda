About
--------------------------------------------------------------
Meranda is a platform RPG game that is easy to learn and play as expected in platforms, yet the gameplay and story is progressive. The player must compete all the levels in an open open world, collecting items and abilities, all while managing health and mana bars. 

Meranda is still in early development, with vertical slice expected by the end of 2014. 

Meranda is a personal project that serves to be a great learning experience, project portfolio builder, and good old fashion fun. I am developing Meranda solo on my free time (out of school and work), with the exception of critiques and design suggestions from peers, friends, and family.
